# Experiments

Contending with the nature of myth evolution prompted us to investigate the very personal thought and decision-making processes individuals and culture groups go through. Why and how exactly are people altering stories? What kind of mythemes or narratives are popular and stable among multiple people evolving the same myth? 

Since our ultimate goal was to build a computational system capable of simulating human-driven myth evolution processes, we were challenged with the task of translating human actions, decisions, and narrative preferences to code. This led us to conduct two qualitative experiments: a series of individual interviews and a collaborative workshop. Our observations and learnings from those experiments informed our decisions for building our agent-based myth evolution system, the Mythologizer.

## Individual Interviews

The goal of our interviews was to observe how and why individuals mutate myths, as well as what happens to a myth if it is mutated by several people, one by one. Each one of our research group picked a motif from Berezkin. Using Misteral AI, we generated a list of mythemes from each motif, as well as a poetically formulated myth. This produced 4 distinct myths with their mythemes to give to interview participants. 

Since we work with the analogy between evolutionary biology and mythology, we defined four actions each participant can perform on the mythemes (genome), according to the types of chromosomal mutations happening in human DNA: ADD, DELETE, MUTATE, LEAVE. By translating chromosomal mutation processes to specific mytheme-altering actions, we create a codable solution for defining the basis for evolutionary processes within the MYTHOLOGIZER later on. 

Interview participants were presented with each myth and its themes one by one. They could choose to perform one of the four actions per myth, and each action could be performed only once. After the list of mythemes for a given myth was modified, it was fed back into Mistral AI to generate the new myth version to give to the next participant.

### Observations
Each participant approached the myths uniquely, demonstrating varying degrees of comfort, creativity, and critical engagement with the story. All of them showed individual motivations, hesitations, and thought processes, leading to similar, as well as contrary final decisions. 

We conclude that the individual character of people plays a significant role in how exactly a myth gets altered by them. We want to note that repeatedly hearing participants articulate their reasoning highlighted the complexity inherent in myth interactions, pointing to a critical research gap: understanding the subjective psychological and cultural dimensions shaping myth modification behaviours.

## Collective Workshop

We are aware that human reasoning, inspiration, and storytelling can be vastly different in groups vs individuals. Myths underlie cultural reality and manifest shared values, purposes, goals, strategies, and philosophies in an explicit form. The collaborative nature and cultural function of myths needed to be included in our research for the Mythologizer as well. The goal of this workshop was to investigate the manifestation of group dynamics and the immediate environment in spontaneous myth creation.

We gathered a group of participants and presented them with the four original lists of mythemes created for the individual interviews. They chose one of them. Their task was to come up with a myth based on the chosen mythemes and to act it out with props. We closely watched the story creation, material gathering, and task distribution to determine important group dynamics and aspects of collaborative storytelling. Aside from the initial selection of mythemes, the only restrictions were the mode of filming and a time limit of 3 hours.

### Observations

The collaborative workshop revealed an interesting and quite surprising fact: the storytelling was much more about the social interactions between participants than the story itself. After an initial discussion where a vague storyline and strategy, as well as individual or team-based responsibilities, were determined, the group scattered and fulfilled their tasks. The main concerns of the group were a celebration of narrative absurdity and unscripted connection by reacting to each other's prompts, as well as keeping the process enjoyable.

We conclude that in a collaborative myth creation context, the narration and storyline itself are secondary to the social aspects of working with a group of people. The immediate environment determined the visual aesthetics. The individual inputs and foraged materials resulted in a myth version that could only be created with these specific people in that moment with those emotions in that environment.

# Ars Electronica 2025

Ars Electronica is a festival for art, technology, and society in Linz, Austria, where we exhibited the MYTHOLOGIZER in September 2025. This iteration was designed as a live experiment, inviting visitors to create their own avatar and culture to populate our ongoing myth evolution simulation.

The installation features Austria's most famous archaeological find: the [Venus of Willendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Willendorf), a paleolithic figurine symbolizing the female body. She is the central character in our exhibition piece â€“ pierced and suspended by cables flowing from a server rack, where the hardware for running the myth simulation is located. This visual of computational elements being connected to an ancient artifact represents the evolution of human culture and technology, as well as the fact that modern rituals, techniques, and narratives are always rooted in and shaped by the past.

# Computational Bio-Mythology

[The Mythologizer GitHub repository](https://ars.mythologizer.org)

The MYTHOLOGIZER is the latest iteration of our ongoing research project on mythology, using techniques inherited from biology and computer science. 

Researchers like Jean-Lo√Øc le Quellec and Julien d'Huy have established research practices that look at myths like living beings, encoded by a binary DNA of smaller particles, called mythemes, that appear, disappear, mutate, like amino acids. This research supports a diffusionist approach to myth propagation and mutations, and has enabled the study of the origin of myths in parallel to the history of mankind.

We have looked at these techniques and conducted various experiments that aimed at understanding how myth mutations occur, and how these same techniques could be leveraged for myth creation rather than reconstruction. The results of our experiments have led us to construct a tool, a research method, that enables mythologists to pick apart and study independent variables in a myth transmission system: THE MYTHOLOGIZER.

The MYTHOLOGIZER is computational framework aimed at simulating the prospective generation and transformation of myths. Rather than examining myth retrospectively, the focus lies in modelling its dynamic development forward. In this simulation, populations of independent agents with different cultures and attributes are created. These agents live, die, reproduce over hundreds, thousands, potentially infinite epochs, but most importantly, go around and transmit myths to one another as well as storing them in their individual memory.  

A crucial resource for our research has been Yuri Berezkin's "[The Mythology Database](https://www.ruthenia.ru/folklore/berezkin/)" (also known as the "Folklore and Mythology Electronic Analytical Database"), which represents one of the most comprehensive collections of global mythological motifs ever assembled.

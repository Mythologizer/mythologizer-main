			The Mythologizer is a modular and customizable research tool designed to simulate the
			evolution of myths across diverse cultural frameworks. Contrary to the historical perspective
			of previous research, our tool simulates the forward evolution of myths over time, providing a
			dynamic model for studying cultural transmission and narrative transformation. The
			Mythologizer is a live experiment. Visitors are invited to create their own avatar and culture
			to populate our simulation. How will the Mythology of Ars Electronica evolve? Bring on the
